## Introduction

This repository contains all of the assignments and input text files for LIN 371 Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Professor Jessy in the Spring 2024 semester at the University of Texas at Austin. This course covers the intersection of linguistics and computer science through machine learning algorithms and statistics.

- Bayes Theorem, maximum a posteriori (MAP), sample and conditional entropy, sentiment analysis, log odds ratio

[Homework 2](https://github.com/eloragh/UT_Austin_LIN_371/blob/main/Homework/hw2_eae2273.ipynb)
- Naive Bayes, n-gram language model, tokenization, log conditional probabilities, perplexity, random text generation

[Homework 3](https://github.com/eloragh/UT_Austin_LIN_371/blob/main/Homework/hw3_eae2273.ipynb)
- Logistic regression, regularization, evaluation, vectorization, 10-fold cross-validation, POS tag extraction, column transform

[Homework 4](https://github.com/eloragh/UT_Austin_LIN_371/blob/main/Homework/hw4_eae2273.ipynb)

## Final Project

This final project was done in collaboration with Rylan Vachon. Our goal was to use X data to plot different users on the [Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/). We used two separate linear regression models to identify the x and y coordinates for each test user. To read more about the methodology and results, see [Predicting Political and Ideological Alignment using X Data.](https://github.com/eloragh/UT_Austin_LIN_371/tree/main/Political%20Compass%20Project)

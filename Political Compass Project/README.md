# Predicting Political and Ideological Alignment using X Data

This project was a collaborative effort between Eloragh Espie and [Rylan Vachon] aimed at plotting different users on the Political Compass using X data.

## Overview

We collected over 5,000 data points for 190+ politicians and preprocessed the data through three separate iterations:

- **Iteration 1**: CountVectorizer
- **Iteration 2**: GloVE Embeddings
- **Iteration 3**: BERT Embeddings

The preprocessed data was utilized to train two distinct linear regression models. Each model was responsible for predicting one of the two coordinates on a 10x10 Cartesian plane.

## Methodology

For detailed information on the methodology and results, please refer to our paper titled ["Predicting Political and Ideological Alignment using X Data"](link_to_paper).

## Repository Contents

- **data**: Contains the collected datasets and preprocessed x post data.
- **code**: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, political compass generation, model training, and evaluation.
- **results**: Stores the results of the trained models.
- **docs**: Documentation and further details about the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/political-compass-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd political-compass-project
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` files within each directory to reproduce the experiments or use the trained models.

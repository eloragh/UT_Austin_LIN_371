# Predicting Political and Ideological Alignment using X Data

This project was a collaborative effort between Eloragh Espie and [Rylan Vachon] aimed at plotting different users on the Political Compass using X data.

## Overview

We collected over 4,000 data points for 190+ politicians and preprocessed the data through three separate iterations:

- **Iteration 1**: CountVectorizer
- **Iteration 2**: GloVE Embeddings
- **Iteration 3**: BERT Embeddings
